# Call-by-need

Implementation of the Milner's abstract machine for the call-by-need Lambda Calculus with explicit substitutions, formalized in the formalism of the Linear Substitution. The reference for this was taken from page 10 of the 2014 ICFP [Distilling Abstract Machines](https://ri.conicet.gov.ar/bitstream/handle/11336/117817/CONICET_Digital_Nro.c2ba07a4-9611-40b9-b2c6-643cc0385c9d_A.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y) paper, where the reader should refer to for clarifications on the mathematical structures chosen for this abstract machine, as well as some interesting properties regarding its complexity.
